        <p>Welcome to our visualization tool for tracking sentiment of company earnings calls. Please ensure you are viewing this website on a desktop or laptop browser for an optimal user experience.</p>
        <p>For this project, we collected transcripts of quarterly earnings calls for the 30 companies in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) from 2008 to 2017. We analyzed the sentiment of these transcripts and computed a sentiment score indicating how positive the tone of the conference call was. Sentiment scores range from 0 to 1, with a higher number indicating a more positive tone.</p>
        <p>We then built a visual tool showing how the sentiment of a company's earnings calls varies with its financial measures (revenue, operating income and net income) over time.</p>
        <p>We invite you to access the visualization using the navigation bar above, focusing on completing the given user tasks. When you are done, please return to the questionnaire to provide your feedback.</p>
        <p>Your participation in this research study is greatly valued, as we hope to improve the visualization tool based on your comments and suggestions. Thank you again for your time, and please do not hesitate to contact us at the email addresses below if you have any questions.</p>
